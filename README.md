## üß™  Project Status

This project is still very much a WIP. Until it hits `1.0.0`, consider the project
to have breaking changes without any warning, for example backwards incompatible
schema changes. You can see the latest release
[here](https://github.com/IgnisDa/ryot/releases).

## ‚å®Ô∏è How to use?

**NOTE**: There is no default user. The first user you register is automatically
set as admin of the instance.

### üê≥ Option 1: Use Docker

To get a demo server running, use the docker image:

```bash
$ docker run --detach \
  --publish 8000:8000 \
  --volume ./ryot-data:/data \
  --name ryot \
  ghcr.io/ignisda/ryot:latest
```

### üßë‚Äçüíª Option 2: Compile and run from source

- Install [moonrepo](https://moonrepo.dev/https://moonrepo.dev/)

```bash
# Build the frontend
$ moon run frontend:build

# Run it
$ cargo run --bin ryot --release
```

## ü§ì Developer notes

Ryot is an Axum server running in the backend. The frontend is a pre-rendered
Nextjs app served statically by the backend server.

To get the servers running, install [mprocs](https://github.com/pvolok/mprocs),
and run `mprocs` in the project root and access the frontend at
http://localhost:3000 and backend at http://localhost:8000. If you do not want
to install it, take a look at [`mproc.yaml`](./mprocs.yaml) to see what all
commands are needed to get it working.
